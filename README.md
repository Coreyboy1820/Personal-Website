# Personal-Website
A website for people who are interested in finding out more about me.
(pictures coming soon)

About me page:
  This will include a user friendly front-end which I will be able to update with pictures and fun things about myself.
  
Comments page:
  This will include a place where people can comment on me and there expeiences with me however, they will need to create an account in order to do so this ensures that 
  it wont be abused or spammed.
  
Log in:
  Users will be able to log in or create an account from this page which will enable them to partake in more fun features on the front end. They will have a custom
  account where they can choose a few extra features.
  
Home page:
  This will be used as a brief overview of the whole website and a little insight to why I built the page. It will also be the main page where users get rerouted to on 
  entry.

This website uses go, sqlite3, jquery, html, and css.
It will eventually be hosted using either a RPI or a webhosting service. The database was also created by me and was made in mind for each user to have there own account and page but due to limitations I will prevent this from happening.
